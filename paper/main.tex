\begin{abstract}
    Precision orbit determination for geodetic applications requires force models even for small perturbations. Radiation from the Sun and Moon is a significant source of perturbation in lunar orbits and inadequate modeling of \gls{RP} can lead to large position errors. In this paper, we describe the short-term effect of \gls{RP} on the \gls{LRO}, which has a position knowledge requirement of 50 m to 100 m in total and below 1 m radially. Models of varying complexity are compared to determine the computational cost of high-accuracy \gls{RP} modeling. We find that the accelerations differ greatly depending on the Sun position, that a constant-albedo model is sufficient for lunar radiation, and that only a paneled spacecraft model can account properly for changing orientation and geometry of \gls{LRO}. A spherical harmonics model for lunar albedo increases computational cost with little impact on the attained accuracy. If \gls{RP} is neglected, the along-track position errors can be as large as 1100 m and the radial error varies periodically with an amplitude of up to 24 m/s, both of which violate the requirements.
