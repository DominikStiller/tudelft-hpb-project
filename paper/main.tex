\begin{abstract}
    Centimeter-scale orbit determination is necessary for satellite navigation and spaceborne geodesy. Orbits are sensitive to perturbations such as radiation pressure (RP) due to solar radiation as well as planetary albedo and thermal emissions. This project investigated sensitivities of orbit predictions to varying complexity in RP models for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) at $\beta \approx \ang{0}$. We found that solar RP dominates but lunar RP affects secular variations in semi-major axis and argument of periapsis. A constant-albedo lunar model and a paneled LRO model are recommended for precise radial and along-track positioning.
