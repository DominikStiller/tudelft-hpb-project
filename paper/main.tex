\begin{abstract}
    Centimeter-scale orbit determination is necessary for satellite navigation and spaceborne geodesy. Orbits are sensitive to perturbations such as \gls{RP} due to solar radiation as well as planetary albedo and thermal emissions. This project investigated sensitivities of orbit predictions to varying complexity in RP models for the \gls{LRO}. We found that solar RP dominates but lunar RP affects secular variations in semi-major axis and argument of periapsis. A constant-albedo lunar model and a paneled LRO model are recommended for precise radial and along-track positioning.
