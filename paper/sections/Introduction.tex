Describe LRO mission
Describe need for POD

sub-meter accuracy in radial component~\cite{Zuber2009}
50-100 m in total position~\cite{Chin2007}

figure with magnitudes of perturbations

"SRP is the largest non-gravitational perturbation affecting the LRO orbit and inadequate modeling of SRP is the primary cause of large prediction errors for LRO, particularly during high-beta angle periods"~\cite{Slojkowski2015}
albedo modeling on moon necessary for selenodetic mapping~\cite{Floberghagen1999}
albedo radiation significant on moon since no atmosphere exists and surface of lunar highlands is rather reflective \%~\cite{Floberghagen1999}
High OD error during full-sun periods with cannonball model, but acceptable with multi-panel model and real attitude for SA and HGA~\cite[]{Slojkowski2014}

present similar papers like VielbergKusche

in this paper, only investigate orbital variations over 2.5 day arc -> goal is to improve force models for POD
Long-term effect of RP would also be interesting (forces could cancel out over time or always act in same direction), but not considered here

\gls{Tudat} is used and models are used for future research


when adding acceleration magnitudes, add ref in simulation setup
