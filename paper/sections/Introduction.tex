\section{Introduction}
\gls{lro}

"SRP is the largest non-gravitational perturbation affecting the LRO orbit and inadequate modeling of SRP is the primary cause of large prediction errors for LRO, particularly during high-beta angle periods"~\cite{Slojkowski2015}

Operational LRO OD does not use lunar albedo due to computational demand, but used for offline reprocessing. Self-shadowing from \citeauthor{Mazarico2009} is used~\cite{Nicholson2010}

High OD error during full-sun periods with cannonball model, but acceptable with multi-panel model and real attitude for SA and HGA~\cite[]{Slojkowski2014}

albedo radiation significant since no atmosphere exists, up to 30 \%~\cite{Floberghagen1999}

model setup:
solar array tracks Sun, HGA tracks Earth~\cite{Tooley2010}
start at start at 26 June 2010 06:00:00
Earth eclipses Sun during this time
Moon does not eclipse Sun (Sun beta angle is about -90 deg, see~\cite{Tooley2010})

mass:
1208 kg (1915 kg loaded mass, 644 kg prop used after mission orbit insertion, then 6.315 kg prop used for each of 10 sk maneuvers till 26 june 2010~\cite{Mesarch2010})
