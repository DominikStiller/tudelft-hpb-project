\section{General radiation pressure modeling}


\subsection{Mechanics of radiation pressure}


\subsection{Reflectance distributions}
Large part of how radiation pressure works is due to reflectance of sources and targets

\subsection{Radiation sources}
extended sources (close enough that rays are not parallel) can be modeles through subsources
every irradiance in the list can be thought of as ray

Paneling from ~\cite{Knocke1989}

\subsection{Radiation pressure targets}

spacecraft thermal radiation pressure can be high
requires thermal model and knowledge of conductivity
therefore assume instantaneous reradiation



\subsection{Occultation}
