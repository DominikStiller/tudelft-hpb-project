\section{Conclusion}

Future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item account for moon topography for occlusion~\cite{Mazarico2018}, could otherwise lead to large misrepresentation of eclipses for $\beta > \ang{70}$
    \item Self-shadowing, particularly for SRP, can reduce effective cross section by up to 40
    \%~\cite{Mazarico2018}
    \item accurate thermal reradiation (e.g. \cite{Marshall1994})
\end{itemize}
