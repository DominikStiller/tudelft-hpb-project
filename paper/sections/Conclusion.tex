\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}

\enquote{It would seem, therefore,
that the influence of the longwave emitted radiation would be almost
indistinguishable from a small change in the gravitational constant of the Earth, for
low eccentricity orbits.
As a consequence, one would expect the shortwave
component to have a greater orbital effect than the longwave component, in spite of
the comparable magnitudes of their accelerations.}~\cite{Knocke1989}


recommendations on which models to use


Future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item account for moon topography for occlusion~\cite{Mazarico2018}, could otherwise lead to large misrepresentation of eclipses for $\beta > \ang{70}$
    \item Self-shadowing, particularly for SRP, can reduce effective cross section by up to 40
    \%~\cite{Mazarico2018}
    \item accurate thermal reradiation (e.g. \cite{Marshall1994})
\end{itemize}
