\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}


magnitude affected by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item wrong mass
    \item overestimated albedo
    \item number of rings
    \item for cannonball, choice of A and C
\end{itemize}

recommendations on which models to use


Future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item account for moon topography for occlusion~\cite{Mazarico2018}, could otherwise lead to large misrepresentation of eclipses for $\beta > \ang{70}$
    \item Self-shadowing, particularly for SRP, can reduce effective cross section by up to 40\%~\cite{Mazarico2018}, effect mostly for solar~\cite{Mazarico2009}
    \item fit new SH albedo model or just use map
    \item accurate thermal reradiation (e.g. \cite{Marshall1994})
    \item account for non-diffuse reflection of lunar surface, i.e.opposition effect due to shadow hiding and coherent backscatter, which can greatly increase irradiance at small phase angles~\cite{Buratti1996} (this would only be relevant at beta = 0 since low phase angles do not occur for large betas; phase angle is low if target is above subsolar point); a map of Hapke parameters exists~\cite{Sato2014}
\end{itemize}
