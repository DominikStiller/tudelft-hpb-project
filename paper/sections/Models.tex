\section{Models}

every irradiance in the list can be thought of as ray

effect of self-shadowing on LRO orbit is small~\cite{Loecher2018}

no seasonal or diurnal albedo variation on Moon, as opposed to Earth~\cite{Knocke1989}

use angle-based model from Lemoine
Constant-emission model from Knocke is not appropriate for moon since it gets very cold
Flux from Lemoine agrees with \cite[Table~8]{Tooley2010}


Cannonball area assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No self shadowing
    \item SA and HGA areas are scaled by factor $2/\pi$ (average of $A|\cos\theta|$)
\end{itemize}
to find equivalent rp coefficient, some authors use raytracing~\cite{Hattori2019}, we just use weighted average
finding a single rp coefficien is virtually impossible since it changes~\cite[p~580]{Vallado2013}

Different values for A and Cr in literature:
\cite{Nicholson2010}: 14, 1.0 (for daily/not precision OD, no changing orientation, solar only)
\cite{Bauer2016}: 10, 1.2 (no changing orientation, solar only)
\cite{Slojkowski2015}: first 1.67, then 0.96 after estimation
\cite{Mazarico2018}: 1.03 +- 0.24 (1.04 in sep, 1.4 in jun)
